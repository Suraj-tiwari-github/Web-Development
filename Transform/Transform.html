<!-- CSS tranforms allow you to move, rotate, scale and skew elements.
With CSS transform property you can use the following 2d tranformation methods.
translate()
rotate()
scaleX()
scaleY()
skew()
skewX()
skewY()
matrix()-->

    <h1>The Translate Method Under Transform</h1>
    <p>The Translate () methods moves an elements from its current position:</p>

    <br><br>
    <div>
        This div element is moved to 50px to the right, and 100px down to its current position.
    </div>
    <div id='skew'>
        This is a skew an element along the X and Y-axis by the given angles.
        The following example skews the div element 20 degrees along the X-axis, and 10 degrees along the Y-axis.
    </div>

    <!--The Matrix() Method 
    The matrix() method combines all the 2D tranform methods into one.

    The matrix() method take six parameters, containing mathematic function, which allows you to rotate, scale,move(translate), and skew elements.

    matrix(scaleX(), skewY(), skewX(), scaleY(), translate(), translateY())
    -->

    <br><br>

    <div id='rotate'>This div is rotated clockwise 20 degree.</div>

    <!--Using negative values in the deg of rotate, it makes the property to rotate in counter-clockwise.-->

    <h2>The scale Method</h2>

    <br><p>The scale() Method increases or decreases the size of an element (according to the parameters given for the width and height).</p>
    <br>
    <p>The following example increases the div element to be two times of its original width, and three times of its orignal height.</p>

    <div id='scale'>This div is a scale.</div>

    <br>
    <div class=scaleX>This box is a scaleX</div> <br>
    <div class='scaleY'>This box is a scaleY</div>
